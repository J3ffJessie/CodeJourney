Simple blog layout using NodeJS, Express, and EJS templating.  Made as a project for me to utilize while going through learning React but didn't get used.



Dependencies:
Node
NPM
Express
EJS


clone repository

npm install

nodemon index.js

Fun project and will utilize some aspects of it for a future project where I create a blog platform for my children to utilize.
